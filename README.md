# TRAINING DUMMY
initial upload

Added my preliminary training dummy mod.

The mod features a simple to construct but weak stand-mounted dummy.

This will need community testing before I feel comfortable adding on the more advanced dummy stages including a dodge-training dummy reliant on a lot of pipes and springs.

I'm specifically looking for any input regarding the materials I've allowed as construction options for the dummy. 

For example, what players think about being able to make a training dummy using scrap metal to mount the training dummy onto its base, vs just nails, or duct tape. Or whether or not long string should be used to bind together the dummy.

Also, if you think the dummy should be adjusted - more armor, less armor, more health, less health, let me know!
